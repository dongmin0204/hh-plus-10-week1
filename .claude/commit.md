Please create a git commit with an appropriate conventional commit prefix based on the changes:

Use feat: for new features
Use fix: for bug fixes
Use refactor: for code refactoring
Use chore: for maintenance tasks (dependencies, configs, etc.)
Use docs: for documentation changes
Use test: for test additions or modifications
Use style: for code style/formatting changes
Analyze the staged changes and choose the most appropriate prefix, then create a concise commit message that describes what was changed.

IMPORTANT: Write the commit message in Korean (한국어).
